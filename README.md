Can tweets be used as an indicator of stock market fluctuation?

Public mood states were shown to correlate with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (Bollen et al., 2011).

Both human sentiment and stock fluctuations are highly volatile, and it intuitively makes sense that one impacts the other...so can that correlation be quantified to a reasonable accuracy?

In this case the answer is no - but that's partially down to lack of resources. Twitter's free API only allows for crawling 7 days back. Essentially any 'result' attained was meaningless, because if more datapoints were added in, the results would shift enormously. Simply not enough data! That was a big hindrance...

Regardless, this was a great introduction to sentiment analysis and data science in general. It set the stage for many more interesting analyses to come.
